Description: user-extensible heap manager for heterogeneous memory platforms
 The memkind library is a user extensible heap manager built on top of
 jemalloc which enables control of memory characteristics and a partitioning
 of the heap between kinds of memory.  While arbitrary user control is
 possible, built-in characteristics include NUMA and page size.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library.
